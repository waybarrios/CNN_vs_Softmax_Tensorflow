# CNN_vs_Softmax_Tensorflow

TensorFlow is a powerful library for doing large-scale numerical computation. One of the tasks at which it excels is implementing and training deep neural networks. In this tutorial we will learn the basic building blocks of a TensorFlow model while constructing a deep convolutional MNIST classifier.


This script shows two different implementations: A linear classifer called Softmax and Convolutional Neuronal Networks (with convolutional, max pooling , ReLU and Fully-Conected layers)
